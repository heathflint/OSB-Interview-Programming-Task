Hello, thanks for reviewing this interview task.

Some items to note:
The handling page contains NO error checking or validation. I can code this if you would like it, but I was assuming it was outside of the scope of this task.

I inadvertently inverted the design colors, but noticed it looked nice anyway so I went with it.

I am absolutely new to github -- I understand the concept, but it'll be a few days before I'm more comfortable with it.

Finally I look forward to your feedback!
